Welcome to App Store, a mobile app marketplace that allows developers to publish and distribute their apps on various mobile platforms. This README provides an overview of the project, its structure, and how to contribute to the codebase.

### Project Structure

The Open Source App Store is composed of two main components: a mobile app built using Expo and NEXT.JS and a backend based on microservices architecture. The microservices include a captcha breaker, storage engine, app-api, and admin and management tools.

### App (Expo + NextJS)
The Expo mobile app allows users to browse and download apps from the store, as well as rate and review them.

### Backend (Microservices for API, storage and management tools)
The backend microservices handle various tasks such as breaking captchas during app uploads, storing app data, serving app information and images to the mobile app, and providing admin and management tools for the app store's administrators.
